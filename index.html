                 <br>
                 <span style="color: #0000ff;">LISTENING PART 1</span>
          </h1>
          <h1 style="top: 555px;">
            She just wants to be, beautiful<br>
            She goes, unnoticed she knows, no limits<br>
            She craves, attention she praises, an image<br>
            She prays to be, sculpted by the sculptor<br>
            Oh, she don't see, the light that's shining<br>
            Deeper than the eyes can find it<br>
            Maybe we have made her blind<br>
            So she tries to cover up her pain<br>
            And cut her woes away<br>
            'Cause covergirls don't cry<br>
            After their face is made<br>
            But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark<br>
            You should know you're beautiful just the way you are<br>
            And you don't have to change a thing<br>
            The world could change its heart<br>
            No scars to your beautiful<br>
            We're stars and we're beautiful<br>
            Oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
            Oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
            And you don't have to change a thing<br>
            The world could change its heart<br>
            No scars to your beautiful<br>
            We're stars and we're beautiful<br>
            She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving<br>
            You know, covergirls eat nothing<br>
            She says, beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything<br>
            What's a little bit of hunger?<br>
            I could go a little while longer, she fades away<br>
            She don't see her perfect<br>
            She don't understand she's worth it<br>
            Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface<br>
            Oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            So to all the girls that's hurting<br>
            Let me be your mirror<br>
            Help you see a little bit clearer<br>
            The light that shines within<br>
            There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark<br>
            You should know you're beautiful just the way you are<br>
            And you don't have to change a thing<br>
            The world could change its heart<br>
            No scars to your beautiful<br>
            We're stars and we're beautiful<br>
            Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
            And you don't have to change a thing<br>
            The world could change its heart<br>
            No scars to your beautiful<br>
            We're stars and we're beautiful<br>
            No better you than the you that you are<br>
            (No better you than the you that you are)<br>
            No better life than the life we're living<br>
            (No better life than the life we're living)<br>
            No better time for your shine, you're a star<br>
            (No better time for your shine, you're a star)<br>
            Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful<br>
            There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark<br>
            You should know you're beautiful just the way you are<br>
            And you don't have to change a thing<br>
            The world could change its heart<br>
            No scars to your beautiful<br>
            We're stars and we're beautiful<br>
            Oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
            Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
            And you don't have to change a thing<br>
            The world could change its heart<br>
            No scars to your beautiful<br>
            We're stars and we're beautiful <br><br>
            <span style="color: #0000ff;">AFTER LISTENING</span><br>
